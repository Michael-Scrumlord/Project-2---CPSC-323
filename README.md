## Installation

Run the included executable 'Prog1.exe' from within the Project2 folder. 

## Usage

There are three variables in the main function that call the checkValidity function which in turn prints the stack flow to the screen. 
The program can be expanded to accept any user input via command line. Currently, you can modify input1, input2, and input3 to check for different user inputs.
